# This is Andrew Gallagher Exercise repo

We use **this file** to practice markdown

We have tried:

1. `git clone`: this is how you copy/download a repo
2. `git status`: this shows the status of the current repo
3. `git add .`: this stages all changes for commit
4. `git commit -am "commit msg"`: this commits changes to repo
